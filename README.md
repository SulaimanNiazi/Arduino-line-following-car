# Arduino-line-following-car

## Overview
This project is about an Arduino based line following robot with a gripper in front of it. It's pins are easily customizable. It works best with 2 wheels being controlled by the Arduino, while the other wheels provide support.

## How to Use
- Clone this repository to your local machine using:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SulaimanNiazi/Arduino-line-following-car.git
  ```
  or download the .ino file directly.
- Navigate to the project folder and follow individual project instructions.

## Arduino Instructions
To upload the `.ino` file to an Arduino UNO:

1. **Install the Arduino IDE**:
   - Download the latest version of the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Install it on your computer.

2. **Connect Your Arduino UNO**:
   - Use a USB cable to connect your Arduino UNO to your computer.

3. **Open the `.ino` File**:
   - Launch the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the `.ino` file by selecting `File > Open` and navigating to the file location.

4. **Select the Correct Board and Port**:
   - Go to `Tools > Board` and select **Arduino UNO**.
   - Go to `Tools > Port` and select the port corresponding to your Arduino UNO.

5. **Upload the Code**:
   - Click the upload button (a right-pointing arrow in the toolbar) to compile and upload the code to the Arduino UNO.
   - Ensure there are no errors in the code; the IDE will notify you if there are any issues.

6. **Verify the Setup**:
   - Once uploaded, the code will run on the Arduino UNO. Verify the functionality based on the project's requirements.
